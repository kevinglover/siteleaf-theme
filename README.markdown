#SiteLeaf Theme by Kevin Glover

This theme is written using the [Liquid templating lanugage.](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) 

##Purpose
I developed this theme as an introduction to Liquid and for my personal site 
[glover.io.](http://glover.io) I wanted to create a focused site for 
blogging and sharing my ideas.

##Deploying 
I am using SiteLeaf for my CMS and deploy, but you could use any Jekyll site 
complier as well.

##Google Analytics
To use Google Analytics with this theme, create a subpage under 
Index titled "Google Analytics." Paste the analytics snippet into the body 
of this new page. This code will be inserted on every page.
