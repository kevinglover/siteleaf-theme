According to lipsum.com,\n\n> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

Simply put, lorem ipsum is bad practice because it distracts from the design and discourages legibility.\n\nWhen using lorem ipsum for layouts it is harder to get useful feedback from stakeholders or even just random people walking by. These may be the best people to talk to if you want a fresh perspective or direction. But if you have to preface the conversation with “this is just Latin text that you don’t need to understand,” you are alienating your reviewers with a foreign language. You want to create an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their opinions. Explaining something like dummy text, could make the reviewer question their credentials, and anything that could make the reviewer “feel dumb” should be avoided. You lose out on valuable feedback when potential reviewers withhold their reactions to your design.\n\nSecondly, you want to ensure that whatever content will replace the placeholder text will be easily digested.

Lorem ipsum may *look* like readable English, but it cannot act as a measurement of readability.\n\nSo what can you do instead of using this outdated method for filler text? Get creative! Sometimes I use paragraphs from public domain books like “Alice in Wonderland” in my layouts. It looks like actual content from a distance, and you can easily test its legibility. Choosing an interning story will also encourage reviewers to actually read the sections, which allows you to evaluate the flow of the layout. If reviewers skip sections or squint a lot, you know there are some issues to deal with.\n\nMake your placeholder text work with your design, not against it. Go ahead and ditch the ipsum.

It is just words.\n\nThe quote is a bit of lorem ispum, dummy text commonly used as a placeholder in layouts.\n\nWhile it is better than using ‘Content here, content here’ over and over again, it is not the best way of determining legibility or eliciting feedback. The reviewer can’t relate to lorum ipsum because it is just nonsense to them. You won’t get much more feedback than “this is too small, I think” or “Is this even English?” This kind of feedback is not very helpful when testing the usability of a design.\n\n(BTW, the quote translates to: “There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain…”)\n\nWhen trying to evaluate a layout, you need to ensure that the text used can be read. That is the whole point of content. Lorum ipsum makes the evaluation process more difficult by requiring your reviewers to not read the content they are supposed to review.\n\nHow can you determine if the text is too small, or the font appropriate? What if you want people to actually read the text on your website? If these things are important to you (and they should be), then you might want to think about ditching the *dolor sit*.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. The following are my go-to favorites whenever I need to add some dummy text to my layouts.\n\n\n## 1. [Free public domain books](http://www.authorama.com/)\n\nUsing text from books that have entered the public domain is probably my favorite method. You can pull entire chapters and re-purpose it as placeholder text. Not only is it literally created to be read by all types of readers, but it is also enjoyable to read. Try using [Alice in Wonderland](http://www.authorama.com/alice-in-wonderland-1.html) for you next design, and prepare to be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you have reviewing your layouts.\n\n\n## 2. [Fillerati](http://www.fillerati.com/)\n\nLike the idea of using text from classic books, but don’t want to take the time to track down the one you really want, then copy and paste the text? Well then this is the tool for you, time-conscience bibliophile!\n\nFillerila takes paragraphs from a list of classical novels, from Moby Dick to the War of the Worlds. You will be sure to find something that suits your needs.\n\n\n## 3. [Malvole Text Generator](http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/text/)\n\nDon’t be fooled by the name, this text generator is also a lot of fun. It creates paragraphs of text taken from old 80′s television show themes. For instance:\n\n*Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn’t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground…*\n\n\n## 4. [Not Lorem Ipsum](http://notloremipsum.com)\n\nNot Lorem Ipsum is almost cheating as it is not so much a generator, but a collection of filler text specifically written for different industries. It is still an amazing service that gives you a lot of possibilities. You can choose filler text in categories such as startup, accounting, or even cake shops/bakeries.\n\n\n## 5. [Bullsh!t Ipsum ](http://bullshitipsum.com/?paragraphs=2)\n\nSaving the <del>best</del> most entertaining for last, Bullsh!t ipsum generates filler text that would feel at home at any office space. The paragraphs are nonsense, but they are chocked full of the best marketing jargon I have ever seen. This filler text would probably even fool upper management! (Just kidding).\n\nTake a gander at sentences like:\n\n*Niche e-markets e-business visualize and revolutionize front-end benchmark networking mashups, portals, e-enable aggregate front-end infrastructures?*\n\nor\n\n*Rich-clientAPIs; virtual: seamless wikis 24/365 sexy networking recontextualize; whiteboard podcasting matrix extensible post platforms, productize networking.*\n\n\n",

        "markdown": "\nTessa started out as a dream of mine: to create a virtual assistant that could control house, manage my activities, and communicate with me. I wanted to take the best parts of Siri and Google Now, along with the fictional systems like Jarvis and HAL, to create a VI that anybody could install.\n\nI knew this would be a difficult task, but I figured that with enough work I would be able to accomplish my goal. As my computer science friend told me, I was trying to paint the Mona Lisa right after taking Art 101. That didn’t phase me; I knew that it would be a journey. And every journey starts with a single, humble step. So I stepped right into it.\n\nI started with researching AIML, the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language first developed in the 90s. It is basically XML, so it was easy for me to understand the core building blocks. The servers were typically java, which took some refreshers, but also manageable. However, since AIML is so old, many of the projects are pretty much abandonware last updated 2001. It seemed like all the source code was written using old versions of XCode that I couldn’t open.\n\nSo I turned to ChatScript, which ended up opening a whole new world to me. This chatbot script is made for server side communication; and it has greate documentation. I was able to easily set up a local Ruby server using Sinatra and connect it to my ChatScript server. All of this is local, so I can access my Terminal and Apple-script commands. Oh yeah, I learned all about that too.\n\nApple-script is so cool. I love that I can basically do any command programmatically, even keystrokes, in any program.\n\nSo from my Sinatra server, I can execute Ruby functions that can in effect execute Terminal, Apple-script, or even Python functions! Basically, my whole computer can be connected to Tessa. Python makes it very easy to get JSON data from APIs, so I use that to pull information from databases like Freebase, Weather, and Maps. I can also send data packets to services like Gmail and Google Calendar. I now have the ability for Tessa to communicate with my schedule, read emails, and tell me reminders.\n\nThe biggest obstacle I have faced is the verbal communication. It is interesting that I didn’t think this was going to be a problem. Fortunately, Google Chrome has a very useful input attribute **x-webkit-speech**. This adds speech recognition to any input field! It also has a cool API, so I can control what happens once the speech is transcribed. In my case, I just want to submit the input to the Sinatra server that then handles the ChatScript exchange. As a bonus, writing a small Apple-script function allowed me to activate the Chrome speech-to-text input by verbal command. This allows me to say, “Hey, Tessa,” and the corresponding tab activates and begins listening.\n\nWhen I want Tessa to talk back to me, I simply pass the response to the Terminal **say** command. And voila! I can talk to Tessa and she talks back. The only downside to doing the response this way is that I cannot interrupt Tessa once she has started talking. Additionally, handling the speech using Chrome and Apple specific commands really limits Tessa to Mac-only. But the whole setup isn’t processor heavy; I have her living on my old Mac Mini.\n\nI really feel like I am standing on the shoulders of giants, but it is really fun to push the limits of my knowledge and make different technologies work together. There are still lots of commands that I need to finish before Tessa is completed, and I still need to incorporate some home automation functionality, but it is still a great project to tinker with. Will another VI come out before Tessa is ready? I’m sure of it. However, it wasn’t my goal to be first. I want to create something that works for me. Maybe one day Tessa will work for other people too. For now, I am happy using her as an excuse to be creative and continue growing my skills.\n\n<div class=\"pull-images gallery col-xs-12 col-sm-7\">[![Tessa-Screen-1](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/Screen-Shot-2012-12-20-at-9.34.29-AM.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/Screen-Shot-2012-12-20-at-9.34.29-AM.png)\n\n[![tessa-logo](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/tessa-logo.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/tessa-logo.png)\n\n</div>\n",

And voila! I can talk to Tessa and she talks back. The only downside to doing the response this way is that I cannot interrupt Tessa once she has started talking. Additionally, handling the speech using Chrome and Apple specific commands really limits Tessa to Mac-only. But the whole setup isn&#8217;t processor heavy; I have her living on my old Mac Mini. </p>\n<p>I really feel like I am standing on the shoulders of giants, but it is really fun to push the limits of my knowledge and make different technologies work together. There are still lots of commands that I need to finish before Tessa is completed, and I still need to incorporate some home automation functionality, but it is still a great project to tinker with. Will another VI come out before Tessa is ready? I&#8217;m sure of it. However, it wasn&#8217;t my goal to be first. I want to create something that works for me. Maybe one day Tessa will work for other people too. For now, I am happy using her as an excuse to be creative and continue growing my skills. </p>\n</div><div class=\"pull-images gallery col-xs-12 col-sm-7\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/Screen-Shot-2012-12-20-at-9.34.29-AM.png\"><img src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/Screen-Shot-2012-12-20-at-9.34.29-AM.png\" alt=\"Tessa-Screen-1\" width=\"100%\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-185\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/tessa-logo.png\"><img src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/tessa-logo.png\" alt=\"tessa-logo\" width=\"100%\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-522\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n",

This prototype has bugs.] The concept was simple. I wanted to create a sticker peeling effect using CSS3 and Javascript. The actual sticker itself could be anything (image, div, etc…), but the background of the container should be preserved. That means that if the sticker is on a gradient, then I should see the gradient undistrubed. Lastly, I wanted to do all of this as a jQuery plug-in. Sure, I could have created a Flash sticker; that would be much easier! I wanted to see if my idea was feasible using the browser alone, and how much work would it take?\n\nThe sticker peeling effect is achieved in this proof-of-concept by creating a clone of the selected product. The copy is then mirrored, rotated 180 degrees, and then sent to the back. This is the “backside” of the element. When the mouse is moved over the element, the height of the object is reduced by the distance of mouse travel. The copy is is then position over top the original half the distance of the removal, thus creating a pretty convincing peeling effect!\n\nRight now, only works on the Y axis, but this was a valuable prototype.

This is about working with the polar opposite, the photo negative, the person that can only say “no.”\n\nBelieve it or not, I don’t mind working with naysayers. There is a special art to it. You have to believe that they, the negative critic, wants something that you want- not to fail. It is important to remember that, even when it seems like they are doing everything in their power to put down ideas.\n\nIt all comes down to vision. 99% of the time, they have an idea of what a successful product looks like, and you are not giving it to them. It also comes down to control. Some people don’t like an idea that isn’t their own. Both of these are good! And the answer is communication.\n\nStarting with a bunch of problems and a blank sheet of paper is hard. However, this is how most design ideas are first created. The idea is born in the mind. It is influenced by other similar products that work (at least to the one envisioning the new product). Ideas are perfect, as long as they stay inside the mind.\n\nThat is why you cannot argue against an idea; they are shifty and formless. If somebody want an idea, give it form by sketching it. Make the idea real. Once you can *see* an idea, it can be criticized. It is always interesting to see me present a concept based off the *exact* specifications be brutally cut down by the originator. This is when I get excited.\n\nWhy? Because brutal criticism is where improvements occurs. It just happens in small increments. Each time a design in torn apart, I understand a little bit more about the critic. Think of it as a mind game. Involved them in the redesign process. Make them take ownership of the concept. It is up to the designer to distill the feedback: shifting through baseless opinion and finding genuine issues. Tweaking the design to give them what they really want, and not taking credit.

One of the first things I did as a newly-anointed crowd-sponsor was to put in for the most popular project at the time: Pebble. I was lucky enough to get in early, so I got the early-bird sponsor price, which was really cool. Little did I know that the project would go on to raise over $10 million in funding.\n\nThe expected release date was late 2012, but it got pushed back to early 2013. All through this, there was substantial hype over Pebble, cumulating in a CES appearance. Of course the media elite got early copies, so like the rest of the plebs, I finally got my Pebble in the mail today, over 6 months since I first made my donation. Was the wait worth it?\n\n### Unpacking\n\nI am easily excited by creative packaging, and the Pebble did not disappoint. The simple cardboard box has “it’s time” on the front in a calming font, reminiscent of the Hitchhiker’s Guide. On the back, a standard product requirement spec, but nicely done.\n\n[![meet-pebble-ks](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/meet-pebble-ks.jpg)](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/meet-pebble-ks.jpg)\n\nWhen I opened the box, admittedly, I was a little underwhelmed. The only thing in the box was the Pebble itself and its charging cable. Instructions to go to go.getpebble.com were printed on the top flap. No booket or paper certificate? Oh well, this is the digital age after all.\n\n[![inner-packaging-ks](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/inner-packaging-ks.jpg)](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/inner-packaging-ks.jpg)\n\n### Setting up\n\nThe Pebble support page made me sad; it looked like a github page with the standard black header and a column of instructions. It’s a shame; the support page is a direct link to existing customers. Providing excellent support ensures your customers stay happy and builds trust.\n\nThis was the first experience I had with my new Pebble, and it already felt like a let down. For contrast, when I set up my Nest, it felt like an experience. The setup page was beautiful because it didn’t just tell me how to set up my thermostat, but it set a mood. It was delightful, and made me feel special for buying a Nest. There were videos and support was easy to find and understand.\n\nI felt like I stumbled through the Pebble setup process. I didn’t know what to do when I first turned on the device, and there weren’t any clear guides. My Pebble froze because it was trying to update, and I couldn’t figure out how to reset it manually.\n\nThrough a Google search (and trial-and-error), I was able to figure it out that I had to hold down the select button (which wasn’t labeled). My morale was pretty low, but I had this shinny new toy and, by George, I was going to play with it!\n\n[![pebble-v-nest-support](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/pebble-v-nest-support1.png)](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/pebble-v-nest-support1.png)  \n Support Pages: [Pebble ](http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/955557-getting-started---ios \"Pebble Support\")(left) and [Nest](http://support.nest.com/ \"Nest Support\"). The Pebble page wasn’t what I expected at a launch. It’s not as user-friendly, or as helpful, as the Nest.\n\n### The App\n\nAfter I installed the app on my iPhone, connecting was a breeze. The Pebble app was a bit odd though, and it took me a bit to comprehend how the navigation worked. It uses a swipe-style of navigation that, while would have felt right on a Windows phone, was off-putting on my device. I was looking for a menu and ended up relaunching the app just to get back to the home screen. The only reason I discovered the navigation was by attempting to scroll down the page. Like I said, it felt odd.\n\n[![ks-app-home](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/ks-app-home.png)](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/ks-app-home.png)  \n The Pebble app didn’t have any visual cues telling me to swipe to navigate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile getting my Pebble setup was a big-pain, I am more confident with using the product. It looks slick, and it is easy to install the handful of apps on it. At this time there are only a few faces available and no real utilities. The notifications are hit-or-miss on iOS as well. All of these things I am hoping will get betting in time.\n\nThere is definitely room for improvement on the initial UX side, and I am hoping the Pebble team makes some adjustments in the future.\n\nFor now, I am going to enjoy checking the time and controlling music with my Pebble, while trying my hand at making my own Pebble app.\n\n[![pebble-ks-edition](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/pebble-ks-edition.jpg)](http://www.thecontentist.com/wp-content/media/pebble-ks-edition.jpg)\n\n\n",

One of the first things I did as a newly-anointed crowd-sponsor was to put in for the most popular project at the time: Pebble. I was lucky enough to get in early, so I got the early-bird sponsor price, which was really cool. Little did I know that the project would go on to raise over $10 million in funding. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The expected release date was late 2012, but it got pushed back to early 2013. All through this, there was substantial hype over Pebble, cumulating in a CES appearance. Of course the media elite got early copies, so like the rest of the plebs, I finally got my Pebble in the mail today, over 6 months since I first made my donation.

Which is not a bad thing. I feel the harsh truth is more valuable than a harsh lie.\n\nThe one thing that I can’t shake is how close the philosophies are to Niccolo Machiavelli’s The Prince, yet how different they are.

They being to be opposed by those he has about him, and this is easily diverted from his purpose.\n\nA prince ought always to take console, but only when he wishes, not when other wish. He ought to be a great asker, and a great hearer of the truth about those things which he has inquired.\n\nAn EntreLeader is honest, unnerving, calculating, and motivated in order to get the most out of their employees. Take away honesty and you have the recipe for a prince. This is where the main difference lies. The princes in Machiavelli’s book used dishonesty as a tool to stay in power and manipulate their citizens. It is important to remember that princes lived in a time when they could be overthrown and their families murdered.\n\nIn today’s culture, Ramsey does not have to worry about his employees staging a bloody revolution, but I wonder, if revolution was a possibile, would have different views about disclosure. Based on his description of his hiring and firing process, I can’t believe that some ex-employees don’t hold grudges. Both Ramsey and Machiavelli warn leaders against entrusting in their fortresses (business) and not tending the favor of their citizens (employees).\n\nThe infamous “ends justifies the means” line is reiterated in EntreLeadership as the reason behind the punishments and rewards introduced. These are things that have to happen for the *preservation* of the business.\n\nA man who wishes to make a profession of goodness in everything, must necessarily come to grief among so many who are not good. Therefore, it is necessary for a prince, who wishes to maintain himself, to learn how not to be good. Everybody sees what you appear to be, few feel what you are, and those few will not dare to oppose themselves to the many.\n\nOne of the chief maxims from The Prince is that it is not necessary for a prince to **have** faith, charity, and religion, but it **is** necessary to **seem** to have them.\n\nUltimately, we don’t know how Dave Ramsey is in his personal life. We can’t *know * anybody’s inner thoughts. And there is no way of knowing what is in the mind of an EntreLeader. We only know what we are presented and what we interpret. The big employee events, the executive retreats, and the book are all symbols as well as activities to further goals.\n\nThe fact that books written so long ago still hold relevance today is so interesting to me.

        "markdown": "\nAfter reading Good to Great by Jim Collins, I was struck by the notion that successful businesses are successful because they identify a singular area where they can be the best in the world and pursue that are rigorously. When Collins and his team lay out the evidence from their study, the conclusion seemed very substantial. Successful businesses develop around a pursuit of being the best at one thing; they are as Collins called it a hedgehog. Unlike foxes that are cunning and try to survive with diversity, hedgehogs strive by specializing in one thing: defense. And they beat foxes with this strategy.\n\nI feel like every individual is like a separate company. Each individual has a input, output, cost, income, and profit margins that need to be considered. However, can an individual be a hedgehog? Or more importantly, would it be a good idea for a person to be a hedgehog? The definition of a hedgehog strategy is that you find what you think you can be the best in the world at and you focus on growing that core capability. Collins mentioned his wife winning the Iron Man as an example. So people can adopt hedgehog principles for their life. But would you want to?\n\nThe fact that you have to define yourself isn’t what I find unappealing about a personal take on the hedgehog strategy, it is the limitation. Over specialization can be a disadvantage in a changing environment, like say technology or web design. But on the other hand, focusing on a technology can be part of a hedgehog strategy.\n\nLooking at hedgehogs makes me think that we are on the cusp of a new ideology about the ideal self. It was that renaissance men (and women) where what people strived to become. DeVinci, Jefferson, de Medici, and Tesla, these were the examples placed before me. These people were not hedgehogs. They were not foxes. The only animal that could describe their action would be human.\n\nWhy should we place limits on ourself? It may be harder to accomplish, but wouldn’t it be better to strive for excellence all around than to build up on aspect and ignore the others? Maybe it is too much, and we live in a “new economy.” Not one that discourages the principles that are in Good to Great, but an age defined by them.\n\n\n",

It was that renaissance men (and women) where what people strived to become. DeVinci, Jefferson, de Medici, and Tesla, these were the examples placed before me. These people were not hedgehogs. They were not foxes. The only animal that could describe their action would be human. </p>\n<p>Why should we place limits on ourself? It may be harder to accomplish, but wouldn&#8217;t it be better to strive for excellence all around than to build up on aspect and ignore the others? Maybe it is too much, and we live in a &#8220;new economy.&#8221; Not one that discourages the principles that are in Good to Great, but an age defined by them.</p>\n",

        "markdown": "\nIf you are in web design, you have undoubtedly come across Bootstrap, the front-end framework born from designers at Twitter and now developed by the open-source community. Since its release into the world, it has become the most popular framework on the web, which begs the question: has Bootstrap’s effect on web design been detrimental?\n\nBut, “Bootstrap is a crutch!” Yes, I have heard this sentiment echoed often, and, (surprise!) most of the time, I agree. For every Bootstrap site that is beautiful, there are plenty examples where the design process started and stopped with a copy+paste of Bootstrap CSS.\n\nMy friend and colleague, [Jonathan Stegall](http://jonathanstegall.com/about/), recently wrote an article criticizing Bootstrap for creating “standards that designers can use in an infinite number of ways” [[link]](http://jonathanstegall.com/2014/02/24/more-on-my-bootstrap-as-new-dreamweaver-hypothesis/) In his article, he identifies how Bootstrap has too much design and creates definitions.\n\nThe fact that people can simply import Bootstrap themes makes it too easy to create a poorly designed site – Good design requires thought and understanding. Design at it’s core is problem solving. So, let’s think about Bootstrap this way for a minute:\n\n> What problem does Bootstrap solve?\n\nWeb design is becoming increasingly demanding visually with a greater emphasis on appearances and designing experiences. These new challenges require us as web designers to work with larger team to create a complete experience online. The days of a single web designer working and producing alone are in twilight. We are becoming incorporated with back-end developers, software engineers, and other designers. And we need a way to communicate with each other to an extent as we never had before.\n\nWhile there is not a need for Bootstrap to include predefined visual styles; let the designer define the border-radii and box-shadows. However, there is a need for a standard way of communicating markup and purpose in CSS. This is where I see Bootstraps’s strength:\n\n> We can use Bootstrap to create a common front-end language.\n\nHTML5 standards are vague at best (let’s not go into the minutiae of the proper use of HTML elements), so we rely on classes to create visual styles. However, this brings up the issue of how to name classes?\n\nLooking back at my own experience, I have named h1 elements in a header as either .page-title and .page-header apparently based solely on my mood at the time. Not good practice, but it happens. When *we* write the code *we* write the rules as *we* see fit.\n\nFrameworks exist to reduce inconsistency and create structure. Ultimately, it creates better communication. I know that if I use Bootstrap as a base, then my team members can come back in a understand the CSS and markup I created. I know that `.container` is a the wrapper div. I know the purpose of `col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4`.\n\nBulky? Yes, but it makes working with other designers and developers much easier. That’s what a framework, a standard, or a language, is for.\n\nPerhaps it’s because web design has been such an isolated task for so long that we have this communication problem in the first place. CSS has rather loose naming conventions. However, Bootstrap is the most popular framework for a reason – it works. I am not talking about the visual aesthetics here:\n\n> The markup standards in Bootstrap 3 are pretty nice.\n\nEspecially, when compared to some home-grown solutions. (MailChimp has a class markup that’s ok, but `lastUnit size1of2` is still a little odd – multiple lastUnit’s and lastGroup’s in a section can get confusing.) The best part of Bootstrap is if you don’t like something as it is, you can contribute and change it! This is the essence of collaboration.\n\nIf we think about Bootstrap not as a style template, but as a language template, we can use we can use it as a starting point for our designs. We can use Bootstrap as a starting point for web apps. We can even use Bootstrap as a base for our Pattern Libraries.\n\nSo let’s stop thinking about Bootstrap as a design framework and start using it as a starting point in our designs. \n\n<div class=\"pull-images gallery col-xs-12 col-sm-7\"><figure>#### Aside: A Few Bootstrap Examples\n\n</figure><figure>[  \n![jumbotron](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/jumbotron-300x300.png)  \n](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples)<figcaption>Sure the Bootstrap Theme is unfinished right out-of-the-box (visually and CSS), but that’s not what it was meant for! </figcaption></figure><figure>[  \n![unroll-me](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/unroll-me-300x300.png)  \n](http://unroll.me/)<figcaption>Unroll.me has a beautiful design based off bootstrap. </figcaption></figure><figure>[  \n![newsweek](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/newsweek-300x300.png)  \n](http://www.newsweek.com/)<figcaption>Newsweek’s website looks so newsy that I didn’t even think it was Bootstrapped. </figcaption></figure><figure>[  \n![dittodc](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/dittodc-300x300.png)](http://www.dittodc.com/)<figcaption>The cool thing about each of these sites is that I can understand the layout of the markup and (more importantly) the CSS because they are all using Bootstrap as the common starting point. </figcaption></figure></div>\n",

I’m Kevin Glover.\n\nI am one of those designer/developer/UX hybrids that have been popping up more often – knowledgeable in usability, programming, design, and business processes.\n\n### Contact\n\nYou can contact me on social media or by my email. Feel free to hit me up for questions or just chat.\n\n- [Email: hkglover@gmail.com](mailto:hkglover@gmail.com)\n- [Twitter: #imkevinglover](https://twitter.com/imkevinglover)\n- [Google Plus: +KevinGlovered](https://plus.google.com/+KevinGlovered)\n- [On LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-glover/1b/99/992/)\n\n### Skills\n\nMost of my professional career has involved front-end development. As such, I have gained a high level of proficiency in the triad of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. According to my GitHub summary, I am a CSS master, but I would like to think that I am still growing in a different direction – web programming and “real” development.\n\nI’ve started with learning XSLT and deepening my understanding of PHP – recently getting into developing with CodeIgniter. Of course, I develop WordPress themes and made this site!\n\nI am recently getting into Python and Django for creating templates. I learned Ruby as a hobby and created local web apps using Sinatra. I am a visual person, so I typically start a project based on how it will work and interact, then start in reverse – building and evolving the product at the same time.\n\n### Workspace\n\nI am happy when my workspace is arranged so I have lots of information available visually. I also invite people to add their own insight and participate. It really helps connect the dots to have everything spread out to see.  \n Maybe I should say that I’m happiest when I get to work with a really cool team.\n\n[![IMG_0814](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/IMG_0814.jpg)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/IMG_0814.jpg)  \n ^ Arranged for maximum space for visuals and inspiration.\n\n### Education\n\nAfter switching from Computer Engineering, floating around psychology and computer science, I received my BS in Technical Communication from the Engineering School at Mercer University, with a minor in Economics. Although this may seem rather disjointed, I believe they all have something in common: they are each trying to understand human behavior. I studied Globalization and Marketing abroad at Aalborg University in Denmark for about 7 months. which gave me a different perspective on things to say the least. Only when I was furthest from all the things I found familiar (friends, family, language), did I understand that everything is connected. We are all connected by common behaviors, wants, and desires. The only real difference is our perspective of what those things are.\n\nSince then, I started working on my Masters in Human Computer Interaction, as well as taking any classes that I could remotely. To date, I’ve taken courses from storytelling and data visualization to augmented reality, color theory, and origami. The most remarkable thing is that throughout it all, each topic is connected to the other. In fact, when I did training for my ScrumMaster certification, one of the group activities was estimating origami tasks!\n\n### Design is One\n\nMassimo Vignelli uses the phrase, “Design is One” to refer to the design process. I also believe that design is all encompassing. Everything is created with a purpose in mind. Everything is designed. At its core, design is problem solving. If you understand the basics of design, then you can apply those design principles anything. I view design fundamentals as tips for understanding how people perceive, and interact with, the world.\n\nMaybe I am a bit eccentric when it comes to design, but I enjoy this thought process – there is no waste. Anything that can be learned in one discipline can be directly applied to another. After all, design is one.\n\n### Work Experience\n\n#### 2013-Present\n\n- Web Developer\n- Emory University – Web Design Group\n- Atlanta, GA\n\nMy current role consists of developing custom websites, interfaces for web apps, and conducting usability analysis research. I work closely with a diverse team of developers to gather requirements, create user stories, produce mockups, and develop the frontend code. I am also act as a consultant for information architecture and content strategy for various departments.\n\n \n\n#### 2010-2013\n\n- Scientist\n- Mercer Engineering Research Center\n- Warner Robins, GA\n\nI was responsible for designing user interfaces, preforming usability tests for our software products, and developing interactive training materials for our customers. I also created several prototypes (ranging from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity html demos) for software designs.\n\nAt MERC, I was able to identify the untapped online potential and redesigned the company website into a valuable asset. I jump-started the company branding process by redesigning our convention handouts, folders, and booth backdrop. Additionally, I briefed executives and the software development team on the latest web technologies and best practices in user experience and design. Since I worked with a diverse team and several project managers, I learned a variety of program management styles, including Agile and Waterfall methods.\n\nMy UI designs, along with the data from usability testing, helped create programs that reduce errors, training costs, and time spent on a task.\n\n \n\n#### 2010-2013\n\n- Freelance Web Designer\n- Independent\n- Warner Robins, GA\n\nSince college, I have offered my services and consultation to friends, friends’ friends, and friends of friends’ friends. Along the way, I have been able to grow as a designer, while spreading the good word of usability and thinking differently.\n\nIt is a deep personal belief that everything should be beautiful on the web. Being able to create websites that make people happy is a good feeling.\n\n- Macon Kennel Club\n- Clemson BluesFest\n- Sterling Waite and the Cotton Ave Hustlers\n\n \n\n#### 2010\n\n- Contract Analyst\n- Content Science\n- Atlanta, GA\n\nI gained project management and teamwork skills under the leadership of Colleen Jones. As part of the intranet redesign team, I was able to add my unique usability and visual design skills to the project. Developing wireframes for an intranet redesign helped me better analyze complicated information. This experience also helped me advance my knowledge of InDesign and share that knowledge with my other team members.\n\n \n\n#### 2010\n\n- Technical Intern\n- DHL Global Mail\n- Forest Park, GA\n\nI improved the previous electronic training sessions and used Adobe Captivate to enhance their effectiveness and usability. I developed a new template for these training sessions and introduced accessibility usability. I worked closely with the branch manager and lead designer to create training sessions, and I worked with upper management to develop an offline version of the intranet for sales demonstrations.\n\n \n\n#### 2006 – 2010\n\n- Student Assistant\n- Mercer University Tarver Library\n- Macon, GA\n\nI created an organizational system of cataloging library expenditures, gifting lists, and potential purchases. I developed a workflow system that improved the turnover of computer maintenance and other IT work. I helped instructors, library staff, and patrons with computer issues and helped develop specialized learning sessions.\n\n \n\n\n",

The team and I were allowed to conduct usability test with students, faculty members, and library staff. Based on our findings, we were able to create a site that performed better by all the criteria set by the project owners.\n\nAs my first project at Emory, I was thrilled by the challenges presented in this project.\n\n[View Emory Library Site](http://www.web.library.emory.edu)\n\nThere was a lot of research performed for this project, including user interviews and usability testing. Gathering notes about user behavior and testing design concepts proved to be invaluable. There were many things to keep track of, so my work space became a collage of notes and sketches.\n\n[![8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57-224x300.jpg)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57.jpg)‘\n\nNot even the floor was spared.\n\nAll that data evolved into realistic personas and scenarios for validation.\n\n[![section-page](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/section-page-300x255.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/section-page.png)\n\n   \n Using XSLT, the team and I created landing pages that would grab information from other pages to generate content. These “section pages” were fairly tricky to correctly implement due to the wide range of exceptions, but the payoff was great. This method allowed content owners to manage one set of data and direct where and how that information will be displayed across multiple library sites.\n\n[![subject-librarians](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/subject-librarians-300x241.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/subject-librarians.png)  \n I enjoyed working as part of a close team developing the front-end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also transforming large amounts of XML data via XSLT. I used my knowledge of PHP and AJAX to create dynamic content and was also able to contribute heavy to the front end javascript. In order to help with the migration to WordPress for the library blogs, I wrote a Drupal to WordPress importer in PHP, so the content created over the course of several years would be preserved. The importer worked flawlessly, and made the library crew very happy, which made me very happy. \n\n<div class=\"pull-images gallery col-xs-12 col-sm-7\">[![emory-library-screen](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/emory-library-screen.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/emory-library-screen.png)<div class=\"callout pull-left\">The homepage was designed to emphasis the actions that were shown to be most valuable to users based on research.\n\n \n\n</div>[![library-blog-1](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/library-blog-1.png)](http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/library-blog-1.png)\n\n<div class=\"callout pull-left\">I created a very basic WordPress blog theme that allowed for lots of customization, such as color schemes and several layout options.\n\n</div></div>\n",

There were many things to keep track of, so my work space became a collage of notes and sketches.</p>\n<p><a class=\"fancy\" href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1407\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1407 alignnone\" alt=\"8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57\" src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/8F78A935-409E-499C-8571-E800E6697A57-224x300.jpg\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>&#8216;</p>\n<p>Not even the floor was spared.</p>\n<p>All that data evolved into realistic personas and scenarios for validation.</p>\n<p><a class=\"fancy\" href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/section-page.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1387\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1387\" alt=\"section-page\" src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/section-page-300x255.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nUsing XSLT, the team and I created landing pages that would grab information from other pages to generate content. These &#8220;section pages&#8221; were fairly tricky to correctly implement due to the wide range of exceptions, but the payoff was great. This method allowed content owners to manage one set of data and direct where and how that information will be displayed across multiple library sites.</p>\n<p><a class=\"fancy\" href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/subject-librarians.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1386\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1386\" alt=\"subject-librarians\" src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/subject-librarians-300x241.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" /></a><br />\nI enjoyed working as part of a close team developing the front-end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also transforming large amounts of XML data via XSLT. I used my knowledge of PHP and AJAX to create dynamic content and was also able to contribute heavy to the front end javascript. In order to help with the migration to WordPress for the library blogs, I wrote a Drupal to WordPress importer in PHP, so the content created over the course of several years would be preserved. The importer worked flawlessly, and made the library crew very happy, which made me very happy. \n</div><div class=\"pull-images gallery col-xs-12 col-sm-7\">\n<a class=\"fancy\" href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/emory-library-screen.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1380\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1380\" alt=\"emory-library-screen\" src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/emory-library-screen.png\" width=\"100%\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"callout pull-left\">\n<p>The homepage was designed to emphasis the actions that were shown to be most valuable to users based on research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p><a class=\"fancy\" href=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/library-blog-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1388\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1388\" alt=\"library-blog-1\" src=\"http://www.imkevinglover.com/media/library-blog-1.png\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"callout pull-left\">\n<p>I created a very basic WordPress blog theme that allowed for lots of customization, such as color schemes and several layout options.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
